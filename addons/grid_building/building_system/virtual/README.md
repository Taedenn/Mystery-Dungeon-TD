Virtual Classes Readme

These are virtual classes that can be implemented by users of the plugin to keep track of which
methods you need to implement for your external nodes (like inventory) to be compatible with all
features of the Grid Building plugin

You do this by extending from one of these classes which will add the methods to your scripts.
Until the virtual methods are implemented properly, they will generate warnings in the debugger
whenever called which helps you to know that they need to be implemented still.

They are not required and mearly serve as guideposts for your code
