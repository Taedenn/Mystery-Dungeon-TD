- This project introduced me to the Godot game engine, showcasing my adeptness at quickly mastering various engines and coding tools within a short timeframe. 
- Further development of skills in setting deliverables and goals within strict time frames.
- Flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process, adjusting to challenges and refining approaches for optimal results.

Learning Goals:

This project exemplifies my ability to develop effective problem solving skills. Despite my initial unfamiliarity with the Godot game engine, I encountered a myriad of challenges and technical hurdles throughout its development. However, through meticulous problem analysis, diligent research endeavors, and resourceful utilization of available tools, I adeptly navigated through these obstacles, ultimately ensuring the successful resolution of issues and the fulfillment of project objectives.

Moreover, this project provided an excellent platform for nurturing creative expression and honing problem-solving abilities, as evidenced by my ability to realize a product that remained faithful to my initial conceptualization. I encountered numerous instances where creativity was paramount: from the retro-inspired design philosophy applied to the UI layout, to the nuanced approach taken in crafting and integrating the tilemap, and extending to the intricate coding required for implementing diverse tower attacking mechanisms and ensuring balanced gameplay features.
